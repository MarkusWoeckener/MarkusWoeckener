- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkusWoeckener
      My background: I'm a former luthier but had to give up my workshop due to severe health issues and loss of eyesight. Now I'm about to start training as a software developer for Java and PHP in 2024 after my basic training for blind people (learning computer-braille etc.). Right now I'm working on getting back up to speed with my programming basics. The last coding I did was in Pascal and Schneider-Basic back in the mid to late '90s. I made some EXCEL sheets to help with some lutherie related calculations (stiffnes to Weight ratio for a given brace-cross section, converting the body-shape in a side-template using polar coordinates and a given radius for the back)
- 👀 I’m interested in getting back into programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently working through the openCodeCamp.org curriculum
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet.
      When I have some skills I'll be interested in:
      - Lutherie related Apps
      - Apps for visually impaired and blind people
- 📫 How to reach me: best per email: markus.woeckener@gmx.de
